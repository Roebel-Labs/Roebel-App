/**
 * `@netizen-labs/publisher` — a node's public datasets, mirrored onto its
 * relay as signed replaceable events.
 *
 * This is the half of "the protocol is the source of truth" that CMS-shaped
 * data needs: feed posts are dual-written by the citizen's own device, but
 * events, screenings and organisation profiles are edited server-side, so the
 * node itself publishes them — each under a node-held per-organisation
 * identity, so provenance survives the trip.
