 * The app's PRIMARY chain — Gnosis since the 2026-07-27 consolidation.
 *
 * This is what `constants/wallets.ts` builds the smart account on, and it decides
 * far more than which RPC gets called: a thirdweb smart account stamps its
 * EIP-712 `AccountMessage` domain with THIS chain id. Any server that verifies a
 * signature from this app via ERC-1271 must therefore use the same chain, or the
 * domain separator differs and recovery yields a stranger.
 *
 * That mismatch is exactly what broke Nostr registration while this was `base`
 * and accounts were verified on Gnosis. Identity, governance, Circles and the
 * treasury all live on Gnosis, so the wallet now signs there too.
 *
 * The account ADDRESS is unchanged: it is CREATE2 from factory + admin + salt,
 * identical on every EVM chain.
