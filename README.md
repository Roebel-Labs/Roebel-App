# Roebel App

Open-source civic technology platform for Roebel/Mueritz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany — a replicable blueprint for small towns building digital civic infrastructure.

Verified residents get a soulbound **civic ID**, vote on local proposals with **encrypted MACI ballots**, and transact in **Röbel Münzen**, the town's own [Circles](https://aboutcircles.com) group currency. The whole stack — identity, private voting, and money — runs natively on **Gnosis Chain**.

## What's Inside

This [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) monorepo contains:

### Apps

| App | Description | Stack |

| **[apps/expo](apps/expo/)** | Roebel Mobile App (iOS + Android) — voting, verification, Röbel Münzen wallet, Mecky AI | Expo SDK 55, React Native, thirdweb v5 |
| **[circles-roebel-mini-app](circles-roebel-mini-app/)** | Standalone Circles mini-app ("Röbel Circles") — trust graph, transfers, invites (runs inside the Circles host) | Vite, React 19, Tailwind 4 |

### Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[packages/config](packages/config/)** | Shared ESLint and TypeScript configs |
| **[packages/blockchain](packages/blockchain/)** | Contract ABIs, addresses, thirdweb utilities — **canonical address source of truth** |
| **[packages/design-tokens](packages/design-tokens/)** | Shared colors, spacing, typography tokens |

### Smart Contracts

| Contract | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[contracts/governor-contract](contracts/governor-contract/)** | Hardhat smart contracts (OpenZeppelin v5) — identity NFTs, MACI-aware Governor, Timelock, Circles membership condition |

See [Smart Contracts & Governance](#smart-contracts--governance) below for the full on-chain architecture, deployed addresses, and voting rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v9+
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) (for the mobile app)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Roebel-Labs/Roebel-App.git
cd Roebel-App

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment variables
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
cp apps/expo/.env.example apps/expo/.env

# Fill in your API keys in the .env files, then:

# Start web app
pnpm dev:web

# Start mobile app
pnpm dev:expo
```

## Architecture

- **Chain**: **Gnosis Mainnet (chain id 100)** + Thirdweb Smart Wallets — invisible Web3, gasless ERC-4337 (users never see a wallet or pay gas). Identity, governance, and currency all live on one chain.
- **Identity**: Two soulbound NFTs — `AttesterNFTv2` (culture committee) and `CitizenNFTv2` (verified residents) — with **scale-aware, Sybil-hardened signature thresholds**.
- **Governance**: **MACI v2** privacy-preserving voting. Attesters propose; Citizens vote with **encrypted ballots**. An off-chain coordinator (whose decryption key is **Shamir 3-of-5-split across Attesters**) tallies them and posts a Groth16 ZK proof on chain. Proposals execute through a Timelock.
- **Currency**: **Röbel Münzen** — a collateral-backed [Circles v2](https://aboutcircles.com) group currency, gated on the CitizenNFT, adding an economic Sybil cost and a transparent on-chain trust graph.
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Realtime, Edge Functions).
- **AI**: Claude API powering the Mecky chatbot assistant (German language).

## Smart Contracts & Governance

The Röbel stack runs on **Gnosis Mainnet (chain id 100)** — a full consolidation from Base completed **2026-06-25** (the "v2 Sybil-hardened" rotation). Identity NFTs are soulbound/non-transferable, voting is privacy-preserving via [MACI v2](https://maci.pse.dev), and the town currency is a Circles v2 group. The old Base stack is archived on chain and in the manifests for historical lookups only.

### Sybil-hardened identity — scale-aware thresholds

Every attestation / revocation / rejection gate is a **percentage band** (or a fixed count) evaluated against the *live set size*, snapshotted when the request is created so the bar can't move mid-request:

```
required = clamp( ceil(setSize · percentBps / 10000), floor, cap )
```

- **Percentage band** → the required signer count *scales with the community* as it grows.
- **`floor`** governs behaviour while the set is small; **`cap`** stops onboarding gates from exploding once the set is large (`cap = 65535` means "no cap").
- **Fixed count** (`percentBps = 0`, `floor == cap`) keeps high-throughput gates (the citizen co-sign) constant no matter how large the town grows — so adoption never slows down.

The gate *type* is chosen by how often it fires: onboarding co-signs stay cheap and fixed; the rare-but-must-stay-strict revocation gate scales with no cap. See [`ThresholdBands.sol`](contracts/governor-contract/contracts/verification-system/ThresholdBands.sol).

### Governance rules (current)

| Rule | Threshold band | Today (5 Attesters / 20 Citizens) |
|---|---|---|
| **Become a Citizen** | 30% of Attesters (floor 2, cap 7) **+ fixed 1 Citizen** | 2 Attesters + 1 Citizen (≥ 3 distinct people) |
| **Revoke a Citizen** | **67% of Attesters (floor 3, no cap)** **+ fixed 1 Citizen** | 4 Attesters + 1 Citizen (≥ 5 distinct people) |
| **Become / revoke an Attester** | 50% of Attesters (floor 3, cap 7) | 3 Attesters |
| **Reject a pending request** | 25% each side (floor 2, cap 5) | 2 Attesters + 5 Citizens |
| **Who can propose** | Anyone holding an Attester NFT | — |
| **Who can vote** | Anyone holding a Citizen NFT, via encrypted MACI v2 ballots | — |
| **Voting period** | 604,800 s (7 days) | — |
| **Quorum** | `max(10% of MACI signups, 2)` — both terms governance-mutable | — |
| **Tally grace period** | 7 days for the coordinator to publish the ZK tally proof | — |
| **Timelock delay** | 3,600 s (1 h) pilot setting — raise via `timelock.updateDelay()` | — |

**Anti-clique guarantee:** attestation requires **≥ 2 Attesters + 1 Citizen** (≥ 3 distinct people), and revocation requires a **≥ 67% Attester supermajority + 1 Citizen** — scaling to 14-of-20 Attesters at 20 Attesters — so "two people revoke everyone" is structurally impossible. Onboarding stays cheap; destructive actions stay hard.

**No-double-sign invariant:** one approval per wallet, and dual Attester + Citizen holders (the norm here) must pick a single role via `signAsAttester` — so no one wallet can satisfy both halves of a gate alone. `msg.sender != target` prevents self-approval. This is *why* the citizen co-sign can safely be a fixed 1.

All band parameters are stored as state on the deployed contracts and are **governance-mutable** by the owner (the Attester Safe / Timelock) via `setAttestationBands` / `setRevocationBands` / `setRejectionBands` — any of them can be re-tuned by a single transaction, no redeploy.

### How to become a Citizen

1. Call `CitizenNFTv2.createAttestationRequest(evidenceURI)` with an evidence pointer. Privacy note: the app stores only a one-way **Poseidon commitment** (`commit:0x…`) on chain — no PII ever touches the chain or the server; the plaintext preimage stays in device secure-store.
2. The required Attesters each call `approveRequest(requestId, signAsAttester = true)`.
3. One existing Citizen calls `approveRequest(requestId, signAsAttester = false)`.
4. Once the snapshotted thresholds are met by distinct signers, the CitizenNFT auto-mints and voting power auto-delegates to the holder.

### How to become an Attester

1. Call `AttesterNFTv2.createAttestationRequest(evidenceURI)`.
2. The required number of existing Attesters each call `approveRequest(requestId)`.
3. When the threshold is met, the soulbound Attester NFT auto-mints.

Bootstrap: three founding Attesters and three founding Citizens are seeded in the constructors; the full historical set (20 Citizens + 5 Attesters) was seeded via a one-shot, since-finalized `migrationMint`.

### How a proposal works (MACI private voting)

1. An Attester calls `MaciAttesterGovernor.propose(...)`. The Governor automatically deploys a fresh MACI **Poll** for the proposal.
2. The proposal is `Active` immediately (MACI v2 has no voting delay). Citizens vote by submitting **encrypted MACI ballots** to the Poll — `Governor.castVote` is disabled by design.
3. After the 7-day voting period, the coordinator decrypts ballots off-chain, generates a Groth16 tally proof, and posts it to the per-poll `Tally` contract. `state()` holds the proposal `Active` through a 7-day grace period until the tally lands.
4. Once the tally lands, the proposal resolves to `Succeeded` (if `forVotes > againstVotes` and quorum is met) or `Defeated`.
5. Anyone calls `queue(...)` then, after the Timelock delay, `execute(...)`.

### Coordinator privacy — Shamir 3-of-5 federation

The MACI coordinator's ballot-decryption key is **not** a single secret on one server. It is **split with Shamir secret-sharing across 5 Attester-held wallets**, and reconstructing it to tally a poll requires **3-of-5 Attesters to cooperate** — there is no single-operator fallback. The plaintext key exists only in a reconstructor process's RAM for a few minutes per tally, then is zeroed. The on-chain tx-signing key (the coordinator EOA above) only authorizes state transitions that the on-chain ZK Verifier has already validated — compromising it breaks liveness, not privacy or result-correctness. See [docs/SHAMIR_CEREMONY.md](docs/SHAMIR_CEREMONY.md) and [docs/MACI_SHAMIR_OPERATIONS.md](docs/MACI_SHAMIR_OPERATIONS.md).

### Röbel Münzen — the town's Circles currency

**Röbel Münzen** (on-chain symbol `RCRC`) is a collateral-backed [Circles v2](https://aboutcircles.com) **group currency** on Gnosis. It gives the identity layer a second, economic Sybil defense and a transparent on-chain trust graph:

- **Gated on the civic ID.** The group's `CitizenMembershipCondition` only lets `CitizenNFTv2` holders be trusted in — so the currency inherits the same verified-resident set as voting.
- **Economic Sybil cost.** Registering as a Circles human burns personal CRC and mints a welcome bonus; faking many identities is expensive, not just permissioned.
- **Owned by the 3-of-5 Attester Safe**, matching the identity NFTs. A hands-free service also auto-trusts each new CitizenNFT holder into the group.
- Surfaced in-app (Expo "Röbel Münzen" home + daily mint), in the web admin dashboard (`/admin/dashboard/circles` + a `/admin/dashboard/muenzen` tokenomics console), and via the standalone **Röbel Circles** mini-app.

> **Roadmap — Phase 2 personhood:** `CitizenNFTv2` reserves an `attestationSource` enum and a `validUntil` dormancy field for a future [Self.xyz](https://self.xyz) proof-of-personhood path — a one-human-one-identity nullifier that does not rely on trusting Attesters, with no PII on chain. See the design plan linked above.

## Contract Migration History

### 2026-06-25 — Full consolidation to Gnosis + v2 Sybil-hardening (current)

Identity, MACI, Governor, Timelock **and** the Circles currency are now all native on **Gnosis (chain id 100)**. Previously production ran on Base while only an identity layer lived on Gnosis to gate Circles — that split meant new citizens kept landing on the wrong chain. The consolidation retired Base and shipped fresh, hardened contracts:

| Change | Before (Base v1) | After (Gnosis v2) |
|---|---|---|
| Chain | Identity + governance on Base; Circles-only identity on Gnosis | Everything on Gnosis (chain 100) |
| Thresholds | Flat absolute counts (1 Attester + 1 Citizen to join; 2-of-N Attesters) | **Scale-aware percentage bands** (auto-scale with the community, floor + cap) |
| Attestation (the Sybil lever) | 1 Attester + 1 Citizen | 30%/floor2/cap7 Attesters + fixed 1 Citizen (raised deliberately) |
| Revocation | 1 Attester + 1 Citizen | **67%/floor3/no-cap** Attester supermajority + fixed 1 Citizen (anti-malicious-removal) |
| Re-attestation | none | `validUntil` dormancy + cheap `renewSelf` / `renewByVouch` |
| Personhood hook | none | `attestationSource` enum reserved for Self.xyz (Phase 2) |
| Coordinator key | single env secret on one machine | **Shamir 3-of-5** across Attesters, no single-operator fallback |

The Base contracts remain readable on chain for historical proposal/revocation lookups and are marked as archived (`legacyBase*`) in [`packages/blockchain/src/index.ts`](packages/blockchain/src/index.ts). The Governor + Timelock were re-tuned twice on 2026-06-27; those intermediate deployments are archived under timestamped keys in [`deployments/gnosis-v2.json`](contracts/governor-contract/deployments/gnosis-v2.json).

The full rotation log (every prior MACI Governor + Timelock + VkRegistry rotation) is structured in [`apps/web/src/lib/maci-config.ts`](apps/web/src/lib/maci-config.ts) under `ROTATION_HISTORY`, and every archived address is kept in [`packages/blockchain/src/index.ts`](packages/blockchain/src/index.ts).
