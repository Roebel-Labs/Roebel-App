## 0. The thesis in one paragraph

Röbel is building the operating system that communities and agent-native organizations run on: **identity,
governance, treasury, and an agent runtime as one opinionated, legally-wrapped stack.** The vision is not "every
town runs a parallel state" — it is that civil society's *existing* institutional mesh (Vereine, Genossenschaften,
Kirchengemeinden) runs on this software until officially adopting it becomes the path of least resistance. The
merge is real, and it has a precedent already in this repo: **Decidim** — built by civil society, adopted by
Barcelona, now the official participation system of dozens of governments. The fork gets merged the same way:
procurement, compatibility, and a real town as proof. **And the first Satzung has to be Röbel's.**

Two products come out of one stack: **(A) the Civic OS** (the four-contract coordination protocol) and **(B) the
Fiscal Constitution layer** — not "internet money," but *money bound to a constitution*: identity-gated,
MACI-governed, rule-split, timelocked, and — for the agent era — scoped and auditable per agent.

---

## 1. What we are (and are not) building — two honest corrections

### 1a. Not a parallel state — the software the mesh already runs on
"Why only Vereine?" misreads what Vereine *are*. In Germany, the Verein/eG/Kirchengemeinde layer is not a customer
niche — it is **the legal form community takes.** A town is a Gemeinde *plus* a dense mesh of Vereine and
Genossenschaften; that mesh is where the Feuerwehr, the sports club, the Karnevalsverein, and the Bürgerenergie
actually live. "Every community can have this infrastructure" and "the OS for Vereine and eGs" are **the same
sentence in two registers** — one the vision, the other its German legal spelling.

So the route to "the new system" is not pitching towns on a parallel system. It is being the software their existing
civil society already runs on, until official adoption is the least-effort option. **The merge happens one Satzung
at a time** (each org writing the protocol into its bylaws), and eventually one *Gemeinderatsbeschluss* at a time.

> **Explicitly rejected:** "everyone gets onto the fork" as an *exit from the state.* That is the network-state
> fantasy this whole Land-First philosophy was built to reject. Every project that tried it converted ideologues
> instead of neighbors. We convert neighbors.

### 1b. Not "internet money" — the fiscal constitution wrapped around it
The money layer is settled or being settled by billion-dollar balance sheets: denomination via **USDC/EURe**, rails
via **x402** and peers, and **Circles** itself — which we *build on*, not build. "Smarter global internet money"
means competing with Circle, Monerium, and Coinbase at once; that is a rounding error, not a fight. **We will not
provide the money system for the agentic era.**

Strip the word "money" out, and what the Gemeinschaftskasse actually is becomes clear: **money with a constitution.**
A stablecoin balance is dumb value. Our treasury is value bound to **identity-gated membership, MACI-governed
allocation, an immutable 50/30/20 rule, timelocked execution**, and — in the coordination extension — **scoped
agent budgets with on-chain answerability for who authorized what.** Circle sells the euro; nobody is selling the
*fiscal constitution an organization wraps around the euro.* We are **denomination-agnostic**: whoever's stablecoin
wins, the constitution sits above it.

For agent-heavy organizations this layer is not optional. **An agent with a raw wallet is a liability bomb; an agent
with a scoped, governed, auditable budget inside an org treasury is deployable under EU law.** That is Layer 05 of
the coordination stack seen from the treasury side — and it is the single most timely wedge product we have.

---

## 2. The three merge vectors

The "fork gets merged" thesis has three concrete mechanisms, all already in motion:

1. **Bottom-up mesh adoption (now → always).** Be the software the local Vereine/eGs/Kirchengemeinden run on. Each
   adoption is a Satzung amendment. This is the Decidim entry: usage before authority.
2. **Official procurement (the Decidim merge, Years 3–7).** A Gemeinde procures a module — participatory budgeting,
   a transparent treasury, verified consultations — as its *official* tool. Requires **compatibility, not
   superiority**: OZG (digital-government), eIDAS, BSI security, accessibility (BITV), and public procurement law. A
   MACI vote is not legally a *Gemeinderat* decision until statutes/Kommunalverfassung say so — so
   [`LEGAL_MASTERPLAN.md`](LEGAL_MASTERPLAN.md) area 15 ("cooperation, not conflict" with the Gemeinde) is quietly
   the most important line in the whole plan.
3. **The state builds our on-ramp (eIDAS 2.0, 2026→).** The EU forces every member state to ship an **EUDI identity
   wallet**, which means **state-issued verifiable credentials will exist** that our CitizenNFT attestation layer can
   *consume*. The state is building the on-ramp to our fork without knowing it. Position to interoperate the day
   EUDI credentials are issuable.

---

## 3. Defensibility — why this isn't copyable

Honest caveat: **Safe / Gnosis are the incumbent circling this exact territory** (Zodiac modules, Safe{Core}), and
we build on their primitive. The treasury tech alone is *not* the moat. The moat is the **opinionated integration of
all four contracts + the German/EU legal-wrapper knowledge accumulated the hard way + a real town as Genesis Node.**
No protocol team in Zug will replicate a legal scaffold for Vereinsrecht, Gemeinnützigkeit, ZAG/MiCA, and
Kommunalverfassung, nor a live democracy that has actually run encrypted votes and a real treasury. That
combination — **Decidim's adoption path, Safe's primitives, our legal scaffold, and Röbel as Genesis Node** — is the
decade-long thesis, and it is coherent.

---

## 4. The three horizons

### Horizon 1 — Genesis: prove the fork on one real town (Years 1–2, 2026–2028)

**Goal:** Röbel is the reference implementation and the legitimacy engine; the first Satzung is Röbel's.

- **Legal (Phase 0, all clean):** form a **gemeinnütziger e.V.** + a **gGmbH Trägergesellschaft** for
  commercial/asset-holding; **self-custody treasury** (verified: self-custody of one's own crypto is outside CASP —
  no license); currency stays a **voucher/Gutschein** (out of ZAG/MiCA); **donation rails** (Monerium IBAN,
  multichain); GDPR consent scaffolding. Design the treasury as the entity's *own* assets (avoid the "für Kunden"
  custody trigger).
- **Product:** ship the four-contract stack for Röbel (largely live: CitizenNFT, MACI, Safe, Circles) + the
  **Fiscal Constitution v1** — on-chain 50/30/20, timelocked execution, identity-gated allocation; run the **first
  scoped-agent-budget experiment** (an agent doing Fördermittel scans / treasury ops on a capped, MACI-bounded,
  fully-auditable budget). Prosperity Ledger v1 + open documentation.
- **Mesh begins at home:** onboard 3–5 Röbel Vereine/eGs onto the stack (Förderverein, sports club, Bürgerenergie
  eG). First **Satzung amendment** referencing the protocol.
- **Money:** bootstrap AI-service revenue (Fördermittel agent) + grants + donations; operating-profitability path.
- **H1 exit test:** one town + several local orgs live; a scoped agent budget executed safely under governance; the
  Ledger public and audited.

### Horizon 2 — The mesh + the merge begins (Years 3–5, 2028–2031)

**Goal:** become the software civil society runs on, and land the first *official* adoption.

- **Product:** multi-tenant OS (generic primitives beneath the civic surface — deployment #2 is config, not
  rewrite); **the Fiscal Constitution layer productized** as a standalone for agent-heavy organizations
  (scoped/governed/auditable agent budgets, denomination-agnostic over EURe/USDC); **eIDAS 2.0 / EUDI credential
  consumption** in the identity layer.
- **Adoption:** expand to the full local mesh + neighboring towns' meshes (white-label); target 20–50 orgs. **First
  Gemeinde procurement pilot** — the Decidim move: a participatory-budgeting or transparent-treasury module adopted
  as an *official* municipal tool (compatibility work: OZG/eIDAS/BITV/procurement).
- **Legal (Phases 1–2):** community energy **eG**; the **citizen data trust** with clean lawful basis; **DAO legal
  wrapper** maturity (e.V./eG wrapping on-chain governance, avoiding GbR joint-liability); **agent-budget legal
  templates**; euro dividend via **Gnosis Pay / EURe** (licensing sits with the licensed issuer, not us);
  investment crowdfunding via **ECSP / VermAnlG §2a** if raising return-bearing capital.
- **Money:** Fiscal-Constitution SaaS + a thin, capped protocol fee on flows; first paying **agent-native**
  customers who need governed agent treasuries.
- **H2 exit test:** dozens of orgs live; **first official municipal adoption** of at least one module; a
  fiscal-constitution product with external paying customers; EUDI interop demonstrated.

### Horizon 3 — The merge: official adoption + a standard (Years 6–10, 2031–2036)

**Goal:** the stack becomes procurable, compliant civic infrastructure, and the Fiscal Constitution becomes a
recognized category — the "new system" arrives *by adoption into the state*, not by replacing it.

- **Product:** compliant civic infrastructure (OZG / eIDAS / BSI / accessibility certified); the **Fiscal
  Constitution** as a recognized EU category for agent-native organizations; a **federation** of nodes sharing
  identity trust, currency settlement, and composable governance.
- **Adoption:** multiple Gemeinden adopt officially (each its own Satzung/Beschluss); the mesh spans regions; forks
  federate. The endowment (Engine B) compounds across the AGI/ASI arc per the field study (H5).
- **Standard-body posture:** Netizen Labs as maintainer + standards body + hosting (foundation-plus-company shape),
  not owner — the credible-neutrality requirement made structural.
- **H3 exit test:** several *official* municipal adoptions; the fiscal-constitution layer used by organizations that
  are majority-agent-operated; a federated treasury/endowment at meaningful scale; the protocol governed neutrally.

## 5. The decade scorecard (what we measure, publicly)

Everything below lives on the Prosperity Ledger, dated and openly auditable — because for a credible-neutrality
pitch, the docs flagging their own gaps is a load-bearing feature, not a nicety.

| Dimension | H1 (Y1–2) | H2 (Y3–5) | H3 (Y6–10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orgs on the stack | 1 town + ~5 local orgs | 20–50 orgs, multi-town | regional mesh + federation |
| Official municipal adoptions | 0 (foundation) | ≥1 module procured | several full adoptions |
| Fiscal-Constitution customers | internal (Röbel) | first external agent-native | a recognized category |
| Scoped agent budgets live | 1 experiment | productized + templated | majority-agent orgs |
| Legal wrapper | Phase 0 clean | Phases 1–2 cleared | certified/compliant |
| Endowment (Engine B) | ~€45k | ~€0.45M | compounding, €M-scale |
| Sovereignty ratio / human:machine ratio | baseline published | trending | headline metrics |

## 6. What we explicitly do NOT do

- **Not** compete on stablecoins or payment rails (Circle/Monerium/Coinbase/x402 own that — we sit above them).
- **Not** pursue exit-from-state / network-state secession (converts ideologues, not neighbors; contradicts
  Land-First).
- **Not** claim a MACI vote is legally binding governance before statutes say so (compatibility, not assertion).
- **Not** boil the ocean: nail Röbel, then the local mesh, then one official adoption — network before nodes is the
  failure mode.
- **Not** over-financialize: some coordination is trust, not transaction; hide the machinery, keep the institution.

---

## 7. Kill conditions (honest failure tests)

- **Mesh doesn't adopt at home.** If Röbel's own Vereine won't run it in H1, nothing downstream is real. This is the
  first and hardest test.
- **No compatibility path.** If OZG/eIDAS/BITV/procurement prove insurmountable for a small operator, the "official
  adoption" merge vector closes and the ceiling is civil-society-only (still valuable, but not "the new system").
- **Safe/Zodiac commoditize the integration** before the legal-wrapper + real-node moat is deep enough.
- **Agent-budget demand doesn't materialize** on the timeline the agentic-era thesis assumes.
- **Protocol-governance neutrality unsolved** — if Netizen Labs can't credibly not-own it, it becomes "just another
  platform" and the adoption thesis weakens.

---

## 8. The next 90 days (Horizon 1, first steps)

1. Charter the **gemeinnütziger e.V.** (+ plan the gGmbH); open the **funding page** (Monerium IBAN + multichain,
   donations only).
2. Formalize the Safe as the **Röbel Permanent Fund** with the on-chain **50/30/20** split + timelock =
   Fiscal Constitution v1.
3. Run the **first scoped-agent-budget** on the treasury (Fördermittel agent, capped + MACI-bounded + audited).
4. Onboard the **first 1–2 Röbel Vereine** onto the stack; draft the first **Satzung amendment**.
5. Ship **Prosperity Ledger v1** + the open documentation site.
6. Open the **cooperation conversation with the Gemeinde** (area 15) — framed as a tool offer, not a parallel state.

*The vision isn't too broad. The merge just happens through a thousand Satzungen, not one revolution — and the first
Satzung still has to be Röbel's.*
