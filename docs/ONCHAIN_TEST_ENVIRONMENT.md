# Onchain Test Environment

A parallel, throwaway copy of the Röbel identity contracts on **Gnosis mainnet
(chain 100)**, so you can click through citizenship minting, attestation and
revocation in the real app without touching the real DAO.

Until now this was a documented gap. The staging environment spec
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-shared-staging-environment-design.md`) said:

> Blockchain stays LIVE Gnosis (chain 100), shared **read-only**. Governance writes
> (propose/attest/vote) need Attester/Citizen NFTs → NOT testable by normal
> contributors.

This closes that gap for the **identity layer**. Governance (MACI) and Circles /
Röbel Münzen are still not covered — see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope).

## The contracts

| | Address |
|---|---|
| **AttesterNFTv2 (test)** | `0x5983F6300bCE3D9C1336a858Bd73F259bB8330F3` |
| **CitizenNFTv2 (test)** | `0x0Be374808A567c9088aC8208B90a4239432B3220` |
| Owner (burner EOA) | `0xd5028284017A32C672CbD73Fe35aCD897bA874cf` |

Manifest: [`contracts/governor-contract/deployments/gnosis-test.json`](../contracts/governor-contract/deployments/gnosis-test.json)

Three deliberate differences from production:

1. **Owner is a burner EOA, not the Attester Safe.** Retuning thresholds is one
   transaction instead of a multi-sig ceremony.
2. **`finalizeMigration()` is never called.** `migrationMint` stays owner-callable
   forever, which is the seed / reset button. In production this is closed and can
   never reopen.
3. **Five co-signer EOAs are derived from the burner key** and hold both Attester
   and Citizen NFTs, so one person can supply an entire approval quorum.

### Why Gnosis mainnet and not a testnet

Chain 100 is load-bearing far beyond which RPC gets called. A thirdweb smart account
stamps its EIP-712 domain with the chain it lives on, and `org-membership`,
`nostr-identity-register` and `delete-user-account` all hardcode viem's `gnosis` for
their ERC-1271 checks. `apps/expo/lib/citizen-commitment.ts` freezes `chainId: 100` as
a *derivation constant*. Moving to Chiado would change the domain separator, break
identity verification across several edge functions, and leave you testing a
configuration production never runs. Gnosis gas is cheap enough that the whole deploy
cost **0.05 xDAI** — the fake chain isn't worth it.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Point your build at the test contracts

**Expo** (`apps/expo/.env`):

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_ATTESTER_NFT_GNOSIS=0x5983F6300bCE3D9C1336a858Bd73F259bB8330F3
EXPO_PUBLIC_CITIZEN_NFT_GNOSIS=0x0Be374808A567c9088aC8208B90a4239432B3220
```

**Web** (`apps/web/.env.local`):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ATTESTER_NFT=0x5983F6300bCE3D9C1336a858Bd73F259bB8330F3
NEXT_PUBLIC_CITIZEN_NFT=0x0Be374808A567c9088aC8208B90a4239432B3220
```

Both apps detect this and show a **🧪 Testumgebung** banner on the profile screen.
If you don't see the banner, your env vars aren't reaching the bundle and you are
talking to **production** — stop and fix that first.

> The Expo variables **must** use the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix. Before this change
> `apps/expo/constants/thirdweb.ts` read `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, which Expo never inlines, so
> the overrides silently did nothing and the app always used production addresses.

### 2. Get the burner key

Everything that writes to these contracts needs the burner private key in
`contracts/governor-contract/.env`:

```bash
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

Ask Max for it. It is a burner: it owns only the test contracts and has **no power
over production** (both production contracts are owned by the Attester Safe
`0x3A08…FDEa`). Never commit it — `contracts/governor-contract/.gitignore` already
covers `.env`.

Without the burner key you can still *use* the environment as a normal applicant; you
just can't drive approvals. Ask Max to seed your app account as an attester instead.

### 3. Check it's alive

```bash
cd contracts/governor-contract
node scripts/test-env/status.cjs
```

Shows contracts, citizen/attester counts, co-signer gas balances and every pending
request with the exact command to complete it.

---

## The two ways to become a citizen

### A. The real flow (what you actually want to test)

1. Log into the app with a fresh email. Thirdweb creates a smart account.
2. Request citizenship in the UI.
3. Find the request id: `node scripts/test-env/status.cjs`
4. Complete the quorum from the CLI:

```bash
ROEBEL_TEST_ENV=1 node scripts/test-env/cosign.cjs <requestId>
```

`cosign.cjs` reads how many signatures are still missing in each role, skips
co-signers that already voted or are the request's target, and sends exactly that
many transactions. The NFT mints on the last one and the app flips you to citizen.

### B. The shortcut (setting up a scenario)

Mint straight into an address, skipping the request entirely:

```bash
ROEBEL_TEST_ENV=1 node scripts/test-env/seed-identity.cjs 0xYOURSMARTACCOUNT --citizen
ROEBEL_TEST_ENV=1 node scripts/test-env/seed-identity.cjs 0xYOURSMARTACCOUNT --attester
```

Use `--attester` to test the **approver's** side of the UI: seed yourself as an
attester, manufacture a pending request with `simulate-applicant.cjs`, then approve it
from the app.

> Pass your **smart account** address, not an EOA — that is the address the app holds
> the NFT with. Get it from the staging Supabase `users.wallet_address` row after
> logging in, or check any address with
> `node scripts/test-env/status.cjs --whoami 0x…`.

---

## Script reference

All mutating scripts require `ROEBEL_TEST_ENV=1`, refuse to run on any chain but
Gnosis, and hard-refuse if an address they are about to write to belongs to the
production stack. Run them from `contracts/governor-contract/`.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `status.cjs` | State dump: counts, thresholds, co-signer gas, pending requests. Read-only, no opt-in needed. |
| `cosign.cjs <id>` | Completes a pending request as the co-signers. `--attester` for the AttesterNFT contract, `--reject` to reject, `--dry-run` to see the plan. |
| `seed-identity.cjs <addr>` | `migrationMint` a citizen and/or attester NFT directly. |
| `simulate-applicant.cjs` | Creates a citizenship request from a throwaway derived EOA, without opening the app. `--index N` for a fresh applicant. |
| `set-bands.cjs --fast\|--prod` | Retunes thresholds. `--fast` makes every gate 1-of-1 for quick UI loops. |
| `deploy.cjs` | Deploys a fresh environment. `--dry-run`, `--fast-bands`. |
| `rehearse.cjs` | Runs the whole thing on a local Hardhat chain (`npx hardhat run scripts/test-env/rehearse.cjs`). Run before any real deploy. |

---

## Why five co-signers

`CitizenNFTv2.approveRequest` enforces **one approval per wallet**, so a wallet
holding both NFTs counts toward exactly one role. That makes the quorum a count of
*distinct wallets*:

| attesters | join needs | revoke needs |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | 2 att + 1 cit = 3 | 3 att + 1 cit = **4 — impossible with 3** |
| **5** | 2 att + 1 cit = 3 | 4 att + 1 cit = **5 — exactly fits** |
| 7 | 3 att + 1 cit = 4 | 5 att + 1 cit = 6 |

The constructors take exactly three founders, so the deploy mints two more via
`migrationMint`. Five is the smallest set that can drive *every* gate.

---

## Gotchas

- **Don't mint more than ~7 test attesters.** `attesterCount` drives the percentage
  bands, and revocation is `ceil(0.67 × attesterCount)` with no cap. Past 7 the five
  co-signers can no longer reach quorum. `seed-identity.cjs` warns you. Escape hatch:
  `set-bands.cjs --fast`.
- **The test CitizenNFT is named "Roebel Citizen", exactly like production.**
  `CitizenNFTv2` hardcodes its ERC721 name, so only the address differs. That is the
  entire reason the in-app banner exists. (`AttesterNFTv2` takes name/symbol
  arguments, so the test one is "Roebel TEST Attester".)
- **`0x5983F6300bCE3D9C1336a858Bd73F259bB8330F3` is also an archived MACI governor on
  Base.** Same deployer, same nonce, different chain — so a repo-wide grep for that
  address hits `deployments/base.json` too. Harmless, but don't be confused by it.
- **Anyone with the burner key can mint citizenship at will.** That is the point, and
  it is also why nothing here may ever be referenced from production config.
- **Co-signers run out of gas.** They start with 0.01 xDAI each; `status.cjs` flags
  low balances. Top up from the burner.
- **Changing bands re-evaluates pending requests** against the new thresholds.

---

## Resetting

There is no reset button — the contracts are immutable and soulbound. To start clean,
redeploy (a few cents) and re-point your env vars:

```bash
ROEBEL_TEST_ENV=1 node scripts/test-env/deploy.cjs
```

This overwrites `deployments/gnosis-test.json`. The old contracts stay on chain,
orphaned and harmless.

For most cases you don't need a reset: `migrationMint` is open forever, so you can
always add fresh identities, and `simulate-applicant.cjs --index N` gives you an
endless supply of new applicants.

## Out of scope

- **MACI governance** (proposals, private voting, tallying). Needs a MACI core,
  VkRegistry with the ~1GB zkeys, a gatekeeper, a timelock and a running coordinator.
  A separate build.
- **Circles / Röbel Münzen.** A test group would cost real CRC to register and can't
  be unregistered.
- **Contract unit tests.** Already covered by `contracts/governor-contract/test/`
  (`CitizenNFTv2.test.js`, `AttesterNFTv2.test.js`) — run `npx hardhat test`.
